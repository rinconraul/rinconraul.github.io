Beyond efficient and accurate resilience, I am interested in modeling infrastructure resilience in a manner that results in unbiased estimates. With this, I aim to translate decision-making into a more equitable practice. As it is a matter of utmost importance, I am currently investigating the implications of model rigidity, uncertainties that underlie the modeling process, and multi-scale error propagation to understand how these may affect the communities in which decisions may impact differently the communities we model (see Figure 1).

I investigate the different types of uncertainties involved in the modeling processes, remarking on the role of models in engineering practice. My work on coupling effects of uncertainties that underlie the modeling process (e.g., modeling fidelities presented Figure 2) with the final outcomes has demonstrated quantitively the impact of modeling choices on the simulated emergent properties of multi-scale systems. The methods I work on include time-dependent system reliability, uncertainty propagation in multi-scale models, system dynamics approaches, recursive Bayesian techniques, surrogate modeling, active learning, and network science algorithms.
